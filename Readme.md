Mod for Bloons Tower Defense 6 which adds a bunch of towers and some maps from Starcraft 2.

 
Currently aiming to get most of the units available in multiplayer implemented in some way with maybe a few from the campaign or coop mode


You can find a exported unitypackage containing all the assets used to build this in package.unitypackage. 
Keep in mind valid asset bundles appear to only be built with v2019.4.1f1 so make sure you use that version

Code is based from the BTD6 Expansion Modules made by Kosmic#4494, you can find their discord server here https://discord.gg/hFhEuJBNrH
