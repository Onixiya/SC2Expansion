Mod for Bloons Tower Defense 6 which adds a bunch of towers and some maps from Starcraft 2.

 
Currently aiming to get most of the units available in multiplayer implemented in some way

If you want the assets file containing all the models, textures and other related stuff, find it here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jFDPRl6W0FM5HK6uNEhRXBxNZL6w8O0X/view?usp=sharing

Not in the main repo due to how big it is

Keep in mind valid asset bundles appear to only be built with unity v2019.4.1f1 so make sure you use that version

Code is based (tho the only part that even stems from it now is the asset loading) from the BTD6 Expansion Modules made by Kosmic#4494, you can find their discord server here https://discord.gg/hFhEuJBNrH
